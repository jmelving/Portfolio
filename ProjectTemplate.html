<!--Project Description-->

        <h2 class="project_subtitle">⚝ Project Description</h2>
            <p class="project_text">
                This was the biggest project I have undertaken so far at the University of Applied Sciences Salzburg. 
                It is the first of three projects I am required to deliver during my three years of studying MultiMediaArt (Computer Animation).
                <b>"NO NEED TO RUSH LIFE"</b> was originally planned as a previsualization, but even before starting, I realized that with a bit of 
                extra effort, I could turn it into a fully completed animated short.<br><br>

                The idea for this project had been on my list for over a year, and I was determined to make it happen. I wanted to seize the 
                opportunity to have some fun and explore my creativity while I still could. The short film tells the story of a driver 
                navigating the Austrian alpine roads who ignores every road sign—ultimately leading to him driving off a cliff. <br><br>
                
                I received some much-appreciated help with the sound design and music. A huge thanks to Kilian Konz for his 
                professionalism in composing the music and bringing all my ideas to life. I’m also grateful to Stefan Wolf for 
                helping me create the satisfying gear-shift sound using his car.<br><br>
                
                I hope all the stress of the past months was worth it and that you enjoy the final result!
